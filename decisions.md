# Decision log

Append-only. Log reversals and dead ends too — a log with no failures in it
reads as reconstructed after the fact, because it usually is.

## 2026-08-27 · Domain: eyewear recommender
Chosen for demo appeal and because the catalog has real weekly churn (new
arrivals, price drops, stock-outs), which makes the knowledge-base freshness
story real rather than narrated.
Rejected: board-game rules assistant (cleaner ground truth, less commercial),
library version-migration assistant (great version-aware retrieval story, less fun).
Known risk: style claims are convention, not evidence — handled by hedging
policy and claim_type tagging.

## 2026-08-27 · Architecture: hybrid, not pure RAG
Catalog goes to SQL/structured filters; optician advice goes to RAG with
citations; one agent orchestrates both.
Vector search cannot satisfy numeric constraints ("under ₹8,000, titanium,
fits 62mm PD, in stock"). Embedding product blurbs is the standard failure of
AI recommender demos.
TO PROVE: Phase 1 builds the naive pure-vector version deliberately and measures
it failing, so the Phase 3 A/B has a real baseline.

## 2026-08-27 · Catalog: synthetic, documented
100 frames from realistic distributions rather than scraped listings.
Gives control over edge cases and over Phase 5 churn; removes the licensing
question. Advice corpus will NOT be synthetic — see PROJECT_CONTEXT §5.

## 2026-08-27 · Images: parametric SVG, not photos
Rendered from each row's own attributes, so an image cannot contradict its spec.
Rejected: real product photos (licensing + spec/photo mismatch), AI-generated
photos (inconsistent, still mismatched, IP risk).

## 2026-08-27 · Face shape is a soft signal, never a filter
It is the weakest claim in the knowledge base. Used as a ranking nudge (+0.15
max) and to justify picks, never to exclude frames.

## 2026-08-27 · Out of scope
No auth, no checkout, no photo-based face-shape detection. The last is a
computer-vision problem that would consume a third of the timeline and add
nothing to the retrieval story.

## 2026-08-27 · Phase 1: naive pure-vector baseline built and run
Next.js/TypeScript app, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` + `gpt-4o-mini`.
Every catalog row flattened into one unoptimized prose blurb
(`data/catalog/out/blurbs.json`), embedded, stored as a flat JSON array
(`embeddings.json`) — no vector DB. Query time: embed the query,
brute-force cosine similarity over all 100 vectors, top-5, stuff into the
chat prompt. No SQL filtering, no metadata pre-filtering, no reranking.

Rejected a real vector database (Pinecone/pgvector/etc.) at this stage:
100 rows makes brute-force cosine trivial, and introducing infra the
naive baseline doesn't need would blur the point being demonstrated.

Catalog-only, not "everything" — the advice corpus (§5) isn't sourced
yet, so there's nothing else to embed. Revisit once the advice corpus
lands; it may be worth re-running this same naive baseline over advice
text too before Phase 3, since RAG should look better there.

Ran 5 queries against the live API (`docs/phase1-baseline-failures.md`
has the full transcripts). 3/3 queries targeting the catalog's
intentional gaps (§4) failed — not by refusing, but by confidently
recommending a near-miss item and narrating around the violated
constraint (relabeling a non-sports frame as sports-appropriate, calling
a semi-rim frame a "perfect" rimless match, recommending a frame ₹300
over its own stated budget ceiling in the same sentence that says
everything else is over budget). A generic "titanium under 8,000, in
stock" query passed, and an extreme out-of-range query ("sports
sunglasses under 500 rupees") correctly refused — confirming the failure
mode is specifically the near-miss case, which is also the hardest one
for a skimming reader (or a naive eval) to catch. This is the baseline
Phase 3's hybrid A/B gets measured against.
